# Enexflow-Internship-Exercise
A little exercise that fetches data from RTE.

To run the program (Docker use has not been implemented yet...) :
1. In a terminal, run : "& "C:/Program Files/Python37/python.exe" c:/Users/jules/Documents/GitHub/Enexflow-Internship-Exercise/enexflow-backend/sql_app/main.py" (on Windows)
2. Open another terminal, run : "cd .\enexflow-frontend\ && npm run dev"
3. Open the link : http://localhost:3000

NB: the "Display KPIs" page is not operational yet.
